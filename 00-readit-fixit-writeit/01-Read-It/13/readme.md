## EX 13
* Examine the parseMovieData function. What has changed? Why aren't we using forEach here? 
    because then it will do it 3 times each movie. 
* Look at the documentation of for...in
    for in iterates over all elements already. 
* Look at the documentation of the .sort(Ã  function. Explain how it's applied here.
    the list will be sorted by year. 
* Notice the 2 console.table() functions. Go back to exercise 10 and console.log the movies 
array before and after the createList function. What's the difference? 
afterwards a list is visible in the console log based on the array. 
Can you explain why there is a difference?
*  because the script build a list and in the console log it can be viewed as such.
